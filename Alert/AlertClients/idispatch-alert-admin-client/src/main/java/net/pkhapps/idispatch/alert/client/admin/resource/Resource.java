/**
 * A resource is something that can be alerted to respond to an incident, such as equipment and/or personnel. Resources
 * need to be globally identifiable across tenant boundaries since dispatch centers can alert resources from different
 * fire departments (tenants) to the same incidents.
 *
 * @param id               the ID of the resource within the Alert Server, must not be {@code null}.
 * @param globalIdentifier the global identifier of the resource (typically a call sign), used in other systems such as
 *                         dispatcher or command systems, must not be {@code null}.
 * @param active           whether the resource is active or deleted.
